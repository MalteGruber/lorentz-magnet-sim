# Lorentz Electromagnetism Simulator

[index.html](RUN IT HERE)

This simulator explores how magnetism is an emergent property of the relativistic length contraction of space due to charge movements. I was especially interested in illustrating how an electron in a uniform magnetic field will experience a force that causes it to spiral (Lorentz Force/ Cyclotron Motion).



This project was inspired by the following videos
